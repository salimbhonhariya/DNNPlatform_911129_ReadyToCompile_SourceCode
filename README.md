// Assuming all the configuring DNN installtion is in place.

Just to reiterate.. 
Download the DNN 9 source code 9.1.1.129 from http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community/download
Ther is a website folder inside.
Replace the whole folder "Website" with this WebSite code.
Unload Test code from DNN project to avoid errors.
Create a site in IIS pointing to this website folder directory.
Create a dnndev database in sql server.
Replace connection string to dnndev blank database.


That is it.
